# Machine Learning
A developing NeuralNetwork library for python.
- Currenlty only supports ANNs
- Functionality for adding multiple layers to the network.
- Functionality to train models using stochastic gradient descent (sgd).
- Functionality of using multiprocessing. Can parallelize with training function.
- Saving and loading models is possible.
- Inbuilt methods for both classification and regression.
- Inbuilt testing of accuracy, error, etc.
- High speed calculations powered by numpy.

Requirements :
- Numpy
- matplotlib
And in future, probably mpmath and numba...
